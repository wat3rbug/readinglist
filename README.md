#readinglist - website for keeping bookmarks ebcause browsers have started burying them in menus

<h1>Readinglist</h1> - last updated 27 Feb 2025.

<h2>Purpose</h2> This application was initially written over a weekend.  I bought some Raspberry Pis and needed reasons to use them (I know the logic is backwards).  I used one for a web server and another for a database server.  Then I wrote an application in php, a language Im only vaguely familiar with) and JQuery, which I know from my C# Full stack developer days.  It was something fun to do.  I still use it to remember old links.  Theres no user authentication and it wasn't written to test my authentication knowledge, but as an exercise to justify a $35 purchase.
